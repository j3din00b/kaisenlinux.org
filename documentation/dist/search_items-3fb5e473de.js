It was originally designed and built as a rescue system as its primary function, but finding it too &quot;classic and warmed up&quot;, I decided to develop a wider and more extensive distribution than a &quot;simple&quot; rescue system with tools such as containerization, virtualization, diagnostic tools for network configurations and services such as DNS, etc. This is why the slogan of distribution has gradually become &quot;The distribution for professional IT&quot;. IT is a generic term widely used in France (the country of origin of Kaisen Linux) to designate technicians/administrators/systems and network engineers. I therefore combined tools intended for system and network administrators as well as technicians within the same distribution to meet the greatest number of needs. In small businesses, systems administrators are also computer technicians. This allowed to extend the main function of system rescue, while providing diagnostic tools mainly for the network section. You will find on this section, some arguments to distinguish it from other more or less similar projects.","ref":"why.html#kaisen-linux-objective","title":"Why use Kaisen Linux ? - Kaisen Linux objective","type":"extras"},{"doc":"Kaisen linux is based at Debian GNU/Linux (testing version) distribution.

Facilitates the detection of problems. *Persistence: Mode allowing to keep this data on different live sessions (by default, the live erases all the data of the session once the computer is shut down or restarted). CAUTION: This mode can only be used with a bootable USB key with a partition dedicated to persistence. More details in the section dedicated to the use of the persistent mode. *Encrypted persistence: Exactly the same function as persistence mode, with the only difference, the partition with persistent data will be secured using cryptsetup and luks. *Forensic mode: Mode allowing to start the system by bringing certain security there like deactivation of the assembly by default of the equipment connected in USB and the deactivation of graphics cards AMD and Nvidia. The swap (partition used by the system to compensate for a possible lack of RAM) is also disabled with this mode. *Charging in RAM: Mode allowing to fully load the squashfs in the RAM memory, allowing to use the live system without keeping the USB key connected. Useful for computers with few USB ports. 8Gb of RAM is recommended to use this mode. The system loaded in RAM consumes 3.5GB to 4GB. *Charging in RAM (failsafe): Allows like failsafe mode and loaded in RAM, to fully load the system in RAM memory and to deactivate multi-threading support as well as direct access to RAM memory. *Charging in RAM (forensic): This mode allows to load the whole system in RAM, but by activating the functionalities provided with the classic forensic mode. All these options are available on the six languages ​​provided for the live system. Default mode This mode requires nothing more than typing the enter key on its keyboard to be used. Very useful mode for testing the system, as well as for performing some quick tasks such as disk formatting or disk performance analysis. Failsafe mode This mode is often used to diagnose problems related to its hardware or to deactivate the support of certain functions which can conflict with certain uses such as multi-threading, management of APM (Advanced Power Management) etc. Do not use this mode if you do not need it. Using it will not cause any problems on your machine or live system, but disables certain functions that may be useful. Forensic mode This mode allows you to start on a live system by deactivating additional graphics cards. Automatic mounting of disks / partitions and swap are disabled. The purpose of this mode is to be able to more easily diagnose problems related to graphics cards (driver or screen problems related to faulty hardware) and to be able to more easily control the mounting of discs on the system. The automatic deactivation of device mounting makes it possible, for example, to limit the extent of damage that can be caused by malware. This feature is useful for performing disk and / or malware analysis on discs whose origin or content is potentially dangerous. Persistence mode This mode allows you to keep this data between each live session. However, this mode must be configured beforehand. Persistence mode makes it possible, among other things, to keep the modification of its graphic parameters (wallpaper, theme, policies, etc.), to keep the packages updated, to keep the data entered by the user, etc. Encrypted persistence This mode allows you to keep this data between each live session. However, this mode needs to be configured beforehand. The difference with the previous persistent mode, is that persistent data is encrypted, which increases the security, confidentiality and integrity of persistent data. This mode should be used as a priority and is recommended over normal persistent mode, for your safety. Charging in RAM This mode requires nothing more than typing the enter key on its keyboard to be used. Very useful mode to accelerate the speed of the live system on recent machines, because the system is fully loaded in RAM and therefore faster than a USB port. Useful also to save the USB ports of the machine in case there is not much to see one. Once this mode is used and you have access to the desktop, you can unplug the USB key and fully use the system. Charging in RAM with failsafe mode This mode also allows you to fully load the system into RAM, but by disabling certain functions such as APM and SMP (like classic failsafe mode). Only use this mode if you have the utility and know why to use it. Using it will not cause any problems on your machine or live system, but disables certain functions that may be useful. Charging in RAM with forensic mode The forensic mode allows you to automatically deactivate Nvidia graphics cards as well as AMD cards. Storage devices are not mounted automatically. This mode allows you to benefit from all the advantages of this mode while keeping a free USB port on your computer.","ref":"live.html#live-options","title":"Live informations - Live options","type":"extras"},{"doc":"Prerequisite WARNING: A USB flash drive configured to support live persistent will not work with Apple hardware, probably due to their specific BIOS.

To do this, type the following commands (always in the same folder where the ISO is): end=50GiB (if key is 64GiB, for security we will put the key ending at 50GiB plus the size of the ISO so 4GiB) read start _ &lt;&lt;&lt; $(du -bcm kaisenlinuxrolling2.1-amd64-SR.iso | tail -1); echo $start sudo parted /dev/sdb mkpart primary ${start}MiB $end You should now have 3 partitions on your /dev/sdb device.

You have been warned. sudo cryptsetup --verbose --verify-passphrase luksFormat /dev/sdb3 sudo cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdb3 kaisen-usb-persistent Then do this for create filesystems and partition label: The mkfs.ext4 command below will ask a question (on the size of the blocks). Just press enter to use the default settings (not affected here). sudo mkfs.ext4 -L persistence /dev/mapper/kaisen-usb-persistent sudo e2label /dev/mapper/kaisen-usb-persistent persistence To take into account this new persistence partition, we should have a file named persistence.conf at the root of this partition with in this file marked: / union We are going to proceed like this: sudo mkdir -p /mnt/kaisen-usb-persistent sudo mount /dev/mapper/kaisen-usb-persistent /mnt/kaisen-usb-persistent echo &quot;/ union&quot; | sudo tee /mnt/kaisen-usb-persistent/persistence.conf sudo umount /dev/mapper/kaisen-usb-persistent Let's close the encrypted channel: sudo cryptsetup luksClose /dev/mapper/kaisen-usb-persistent Your key is now ready! Restart a live Kaisen with the encrypted persistence option enabled. To test that the persistence is functional, for example change the theme of the graphical interface then restart your live session by always choosing &quot;encrypted persistence&quot;. If the theme you modified has been kept instead of the default one, encrypted persistence is functional.

You just need to follow the requested steps, and wait for the process to finish. I will not detail here the installation process in rescue or expert mode (these modes are reserved for advanced users), but only what the installer does. Here are the steps you will have to follow: Select the language of the installer, the system and the keyboard Select your hostname Create your user and user password (you have to put password) After it will ask you to partition your disk. For less advanced users, select assisted partitioning and put the whole system in a single partition The system will then install If you are in UEFI mode, which will surely happen on your current machines, once the installation is complete, the GRUB will automatically install in the right place and the PC will restart with your system ready for use. Partitioning recommendations On disks below 70Gb, if you use assisted partitioning on the installer do not ask to separate the partitions /home, /var and /tmp. The system will leave little space on the / and can be problematic. Here is the cause of the problem and how to fix it: Indeed, the root system, the / must have at least 15GB of space to be able to install the whole system. Below 70Gb, the / will be too small in size and the system unstable or may crash during installation due to lack of space to continue the operation. However, you will still be able to partition your disks yourself, use LVM, and encryption. But no matter which assisted partitioning mode you use, on small disks do not use partitioning with the 3 partitions mentioned above, you will have problems. I advise you to partition yourself by taking into account this constraint on the /. I also advise you to manage the partitioning of the disk yourself or to use LVM to facilitate the repartitioning of your disks in the future. Recommendations on filesystems Kaisen Linux uses the BTRFS file system by default on automatic partitioning because a snapshot feature has been integrated by default and allows you to take snapshots of your system. If you are installing Kaisen Linux through manual partitioning, we recommend that you use BTRFS on all your partitions in order to take full advantage of the features offered by Kaisen Linux. You should also leave the default mountpoints options provided with the BTRFS file system selection, these options are optimized for BTRFS and for Kaisen Linux. Installation in BTRFS When BTRFS is used for the / partition, the tools in the kaisen-btrfs-snapshot metapackage are installed by default when NETINST is used, or retained via installation from a live installer. This allows the user to install these tools only if his system configuration allows system snapshot.","ref":"install.html#recommendations","title":"Install OS - Recommendations","type":"extras"},{"doc":"The preseed file is a file used by the Debian installer (the default one is contained in the initrd generated by the installer, modifying it can completely alter the installer and make it absolutely unusable, even if it can be spotted without too many problems , avoid going that far).

Network tools are divided into several categories such as PCAP (frame capture tools), GNS3, Port Console, VPN and many others. The tools in the network tools section are mainly diagnostic and troubleshooting tools mainly on layers 1 to 4 of the OSI model. Some security tools like Nmap or Wireshark are integrated, even if they are used a lot in offensive security, they can also be major assets to secure an IS. The system tools are mainly remote administration, backup and virtualization tools (type 2 hypervisors), DNS (DNS diagnostic tools), SSL/TLS (TLS certificate analysis) and many others. This category is therefore purely focused on the administration of Windows and Linux systems. Tools like parallel-ssh, rsync, zsync, ab, xca to name a few are classified in this category and its subcategories. Cloud and DevOps tools are a collection of tools for cloud engineers such as trivy, terraform, k6, k9s and others! Tools for technicians In this menu, are stored all the tools dedicated to the maintenance of computers and their hardware peripherals and operating systems. Several subcategories exist in this menu like disk scan, data recovery, mount tools etc ... Tools like gsmartcontrol, gparted, ddrescue, testdisk, photorec can be found. These tools can also be used by system administrators as part of some of their functions and not just by IT technicians. Data and disk encryption tools are also classified as well. Various tools In this menu, are stored the launchers that cannot be entered in the menu for system and network administrators or technicians, because they are too generic. Can be found there for example midnight commander, progress, and also some scripts developed for Kaisen Linux like for example, the kaisen-interface-switcher and kaisen-update (automation of updates and cleaning of non-essential packages). The kaisen-interface-switcher as well as kaisen-update can be launched directly via the menu because they do not require specific arguments to run. Filesystems The menu for file systems is a menu that allows to simply reference the tools and commands that can be used to administer, repair, create, diagnose different file systems such as BTRFS, ExFAT, NTFS, XFS, EXT4 etc ... In this category, is contained for example the commands mkfs (create a filesystem on a partition), fsck (repair the filesystem of a partition) etc ... These launchers open a full help or man page. Services This menu has been specially designed to simplify the management of services in a simple way. All the services added by the tools present by default in the distribution are disabled for performance and resource saving reasons. Launchers point to scripts in /opt/services, and are sorted by the name of the service, for example, Avahi, 2ping, etc. Certain categories like containerization as well as virtualization encompass multiple launchers. For example in virtualization, the services for QEMU/KVM, VirtualBox and VMWare are arranged here, this allows to reduce the size of the menu. There are also two additional scripts that allow them to turn everything on or off, to avoid having to manually turn each service on or off in the categories. On these two scripts, logical conditions exist to allow you to run these scripts even if the commands executed by this script return an error because the service does not exist. Scripts can also be started manually with the terminal, but are not intentionally present in /usr/sbin or /sbin because they are intended to be used from the menu (which will only reference the launchers of the installed services).","ref":"menu.html#kaisen-linux-submenus","title":"Menu and Tools overview - Kaisen Linux submenus","type":"extras"},{"doc":"All launchers of each category are present in the menu only if the package associated with the program executed by the launcher is present on the system.

I modified this package to modify the following configurations: *Replace the default bash shell on zsh for user levels in file /etc/adduser.conf *Allow the deletion of the folder associated with a deleted user (/home/userdelete) when it is deleted with the delsuer command in file /etc/deluser.conf base-files The base-files package will simply provide the following files on the system: */etc/debian_version */etc/issue */etc/issue.net */etc/os-release These files are used to identify the system version in details, such as the system version number, distribution name, code name, etc. These files are used by the live system during the welcome message on the system (here Debian has been replaced by Kaisen Linux). They are also used to customize GRUB thanks to the lsb_release package which, in its default configuration will read the /etc/os-release file to find out the version of the OS. By consequently, personalize the GRUB entries in its default configuration by the command lsb_release -i -s (information present in /etc/default/grub at the line GRUB_DISTRIBUTOR) when executing the update-grub command. The goal here was to replace Debian with Kaisen on the GRUB entries of the installed system. This package surely has many other uses, but I have not encountered them so far. The package has therefore been recompiled to formalize the name of the distribution on the system and customize it a little more. linux The kernel has been recompiled to generate .udeb files (used by the Debian installer) as well as .deb files needed to install it via apt or dpkg. The Kaisen Linux kernel has its own lean configuration. The kernel is also recompiled to disable signing modules because signing modules breaks GRUB with Kaisen Linux configuration. debian-installer This package is forked to build the installer with the custom Kaisen Linux kernel as well as our packages used by the installer (rootskel-gtk for example). It is necessary to rebuild the installer to integrate the modified packages for the installer and thus integrate them into the rolling release ISO. rootskel-gtk This package has been modified because it provides the graphical configuration of the installer (theme, banners). The theme of the Kaisen Linux graphical installer is based on the original Clearlooks theme. apt-setup This package allows you to configure the /etc/apt/sources.list file after installing the system. Since the Kaisen Linux installer is configured to request no network configuration, this package has been forked to add the Kaisen Linux repository, because by default, without internet connection (therefore no mirror selection), apt-setup will configure the Debian security repositories. choose-mirror This package configures the mirrors to be used to download packages. partman-auto This package, as its name suggests, allows you to automatically partition the disk during installation. This package was forked for three things: Use of BTRFS as default file system on all partitions of the disk (except /boot if the partition is separated) Definition of EXT4 as the default file system for /boot if the partition is separate from / (this is the case for example during the installation of the system with LVM and cryptsetup). Modification of the size of the partitions allocated by partman to adapt it to the size required by Kaisen Linux and thus limit any problems that may appear on insufficient disk space (especially in case of separation of the partitions /home /var /tmp and /). debootstrap This package builds and installs the base system (the packages mentioned as required). This package is forked to integrate the specific configurations of Kaisen Linux (build the base system from the distribution repository). desktop-base This package provides wallpapers for the desktop, login screen, grub etc ... This package is forked to add the different Kaisen themes on the system to provide wallpapers as well as &quot;alternatives&quot; to define by default the theme to use. It is by default configured on kaisen-theme. grub2 This package was forked to integrate the kaisen-grub-configuration package as a dependency. This allowed the possibility of providing a GRUB image even when the machine is encrypted and activating the plymouth theme. live-build It is the official Debian tool for building system images. It was forked to add support for the &quot;kaisen-rolling&quot; repository. live-config This package contains all live configurations. Forked to add components/0031-kaisen-password script. This script add a password for live system. shadow This package was forked because the /etc/default/useradd file was modified to support /bin/zsh as the default terminal when adding a user. The number of users to add to the system has also been changed. Maximum 100 users can be added (by default, 58999 users can be added). live-installer Forked to add 61kaisen script to launch this script after the system installation. plymouth Forked to define kaisen-theme by default for Plymouth. partman-btrfs Forked to create BTRFS subvolumes simple-cdd Forked to add kaisen profile. The kaisen profile add a custom preseed for NETINST ISO, and add a postinst script to exec a few actions after the installation. debian-cd Forked to adding kaisen-rolling repository tasksel Forked to adding Kaisen Linux tasks lightdm-gtk-greeter Forked to add Kaisen Linux lightdm settings net-retriever Forked to add kaisen-archive-keyring-udeb package neofetch Forked to add Kaisen Linux ASCII logo docker.io Forked to add a conffile to change the default storage driver will be used by Docker virtualbox Forked to add a conffile to load automatically vbox modules at boot virtualbox-ext-pack Forked to change the default response provided by debconf virtualbox-guest-additions Forked to adapt the dependencies to the rest of the VirtualBox packages virtualbox-ext-pack Forked to change default debconf python-async-timeout Forked to adapt the distributed version to the version required by GNS3","ref":"packages.html#forked-packages","title":"Packages - Forked packages","type":"extras"},{"doc":"kaisen-basemenu-purge This package removes &quot;double&quot; launchers. These duplicate icons appear when updating packages containing a launcher for a graphical application, for example ettercap, lftp, kismet etc ... Custom launchers have been created for the Kaisen menu to organize them by categories (monitoring, scanner etc). The custom launchers are also launched with sudo if necessary by the software. This package therefore removes the original launchers contained in /usr/share/applications kaisen-grub-configuration The GRUB package has been recompiled to change the configuration of the /etc/default/grub file to add support for the default splash screen for the user on the installed system (graphical boot) and also allow in case the command lsb_release -i -s cannot be executed because the lsb-release script is not present, you can still display Kaisen and not Debian in the GRUB entries. The kaisen-grub-configuration package is installed automatically during system installation and automates this customization. kaisen-archive-keyring This package provides the public GPG keys needed to use our secure repository with identity verification via a GPG key (used by official Debian repositories and implemented security by default). kaisen-menu This package provides the custom menu. This includes the &quot;skeleton&quot; of the menu (allows you to organize the location of the different folders), the directories as well as the launchers of the applications. This menu is mainly used to reference the tools present in the distribution. kaisen-services-management This package provides various bash scripts allowing you to easily manage additional services (added by software supplied with the distribution). The scripts are installed in /opt/services . This package coupled with the &quot;kaisen-menu&quot; package allows you to reference and execute directly via the menu the scripts classified by service to activate or deactivate additional services. Two activation and deactivation scripts exist for all services. kaisen-update This package just provides a script to perform an apt update &amp;&amp; apt upgrade in one command. The kaisen-update command also allows to remove the most necessary packages (dependencies no longer used). kaisen-build This package contains all configurations for build Kaisen Linux ISO. kaisen-interfaces All Kaisen Linux MATE Desktop Environment configurations (themes, icons etc). All Kaisen Linux KDE Desktop Environment configurations (themes, icons etc). All Kaisen Linux LXQT Desktop Environment configurations (themes, icons etc). All Kaisen Linux XFCE Desktop Environment configurations (themes, icons etc). The package kaisen-interface-common package installs the kaisen-interface-switcher command and commons packages for all interfaces. kaisen-skeleton This allows you to have launchers on the desktop, the conky theme... This package replaces the old kaisen-*-default-profile packages which installed only the default profile of the related interface. This package installs the kaisen-update-skel command. kaisen-manpages This package is simply an offline implementation of the entire https://kaisenlinux.org/manpages/ domain in order to access the centralized manpages of the tools built into Kaisen Linux without requiring an internet connection. kaisen-documentation This package is simply an offline implementation of the entire https://kaisenlinux.org/documentation/ domain in order to access the centralized documentation without requiring an internet connection. kaisen-design This package contains all themes and icons for Kaisen Linux kaisen-conky Conky theme for Kaisen Linux kaisen-winkey-recovery Official Kaisen Linux tool to recover OEM Windows key veracrypt Tool to HDD, SSD and system disks encryption. woeusb Tool to create Windows USB bootable key (written in Bash). woeusb-ng Tool to create Windows USB bootable key (written in Python) gns3-server Tool to network simulator (server package) gns3-gui Tool to network simulator (client package) apfs-fuse FUSE driver for Apple FileSystem ubridge Bridge for UDP tunnels, Ethernet, TAP and VMnet interfaces vpcs Simple Virtual PC Simulator dynamips Router emulator for GNS3 neo4j Graph for everyone bettercap Tool to testing the possibility of MITM attacks on Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Ethernet and more. bettercap-caplets Caplets and proxy modules. bettercap-ui Bettercap's web UI hfsprescue Tool specialized in recovering data from HFS + partitions. conkycolors Tool developed with the aim of simplifying the configuration of the Conky theme.

During rolling repository updates, all the packages in this repository are &quot;pull&quot; on kaisen-rolling to restore them after their removal due to the update of the repository. It is also used as stock when the updated packages are ready to go into production (kaisen-rolling). kaisen-packages This repository simply stores forked/developed packages for Kaisen Linux. It is mainly used as a backup of kaisen-devel. It also serves as an environment for testing new versions of packages before pushing packages to kaisen-devel which will push these new packages to kaisen-rolling itself.

When the kaisen-conky package is updated, the theme will be automatically updated in all user directories having their directory in /home. Launch conky with a custom theme It's easy to run your own conky setup.

Problems with KDE desktop I have seen some issues with KDE. The conky is initially configured to be completely transparent and integrated into the wallpaper. KDE is initially configured to start programs that were not closed from the previous session, and Conky is one of them.

Relaunch conky manually Sometimes, Conky may not automatically relaunch after a package update. To relaunch it, it is very simple. Open a terminal window, and type this command: conky&amp; Next this command, press ctrl +D until closing the terminal. Conky is now relaunched.

Snapshots with BTRFS commands To take a snapshot of the entire system from the command line: sudo btrfs subvolume snapshot / /opt/snapshot20210330 This command will take a snaphsot from the test subvolume (directory). This frozen version of your directory will be accessible through the &quot;/opt/snapshot20210330&quot; directory. The modifications made in each of the two directories are independent. The filesystem manages the changes so that they are transparent to the user (with ext4, it would have been necessary to create a copy of the directory, which would have occupied double the disk space. A snapshot does not consume any additional disk space). Restore snapshot To restore the snapshot taken previously, the following command can be used: sudo btrfs subvolume get-default / APT snapshots APT snapshots are handled by the apt-btrfs-snapshot package. Whenever APT is used for a package update or installation, a snapshot will be automatically taken. If an upgrade or a package installation goes wrong it is easy to go back with these commands: sudo apt-btrfs-snapshot list This command will list all snapshots taken by apt-btrfs-snapshot.

We have not, despite our attachment to system security, not disabled the possibility of putting a password on root after installation (sudo passwd root command) nor have we disabled the sudo su or su root. We believe that as users, you are free to use the system as you see fit, without any particular constraints. However, we always advise you to use sudo when you need root is to leave root disabled (without password), this can save you from some errors that can harm your system.","ref":"why-root-account-is-disabled.html#so-how-do-you-get-root-rights","title":"Why root account is disabled? - So how do you get root rights?","type":"extras"},{"doc":"We do not recommend using the root account from a graphical session. And this because increases the risk of making a false manipulation, creating directories with root rights when root is not necessary, and others. Some scripts developed for Kaisen Linux are also developed only for regular user accounts (even without sudo rights), because root should not be used from a graphical session. This will surely never change, admittedly I remove you by default the possibility to put a password on root, but you can entirely use it in command line via the commands sudo su - or sudo -i .","ref":"why-root-account-is-disabled.html#advice","title":"Why root account is disabled? - Advice","type":"extras"},{"doc":"Use sudo when you need root.
