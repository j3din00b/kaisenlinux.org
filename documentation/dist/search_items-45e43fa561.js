It was originally designed and built as a rescue system as its primary function, but finding it too &quot;classic and warmed up&quot;, I decided to develop a wider and more extensive distribution than a &quot;simple&quot; rescue system with tools such as containerization, virtualization, diagnostic tools for network configurations and services such as DNS, etc. This is why the slogan of distribution has gradually become &quot;The distribution for professional IT&quot;. IT is a generic term widely used in France (the country of origin of Kaisen Linux) to designate technicians/administrators/systems and network engineers. I therefore combined tools intended for system and network administrators as well as technicians within the same distribution to meet the greatest number of needs. In small businesses, systems administrators are also computer technicians. This allowed to extend the main function of system rescue, while providing diagnostic tools mainly for the network section. You will find on this section, some arguments to distinguish it from other more or less similar projects.","ref":"why.html#kaisen-linux-objective","title":"Why use Kaisen Linux ? - Kaisen Linux objective","type":"extras"},{"doc":"Kaisen linux is based at Debian GNU/Linux (testing version) distribution.

Facilitates the detection of problems. *Persistence: Mode allowing to keep this data on different live sessions (by default, the live erases all the data of the session once the computer is shut down or restarted). CAUTION: This mode can only be used with a bootable USB key with a partition dedicated to persistence. More details in the section dedicated to the use of the persistent mode. *Encrypted persistence: Exactly the same function as persistence mode, with the only difference, the partition with persistent data will be secured using cryptsetup and luks. *Forensic mode: Mode allowing to start the system by bringing certain security there like deactivation of the assembly by default of the equipment connected in USB and the deactivation of graphics cards AMD and Nvidia. The swap (partition used by the system to compensate for a possible lack of RAM) is also disabled with this mode. *Charging in RAM: Mode allowing to fully load the squashfs in the RAM memory, allowing to use the live system without keeping the USB key connected. Useful for computers with few USB ports. 8Gb of RAM is recommended to use this mode. The system loaded in RAM consumes 3.5GB to 4GB. *Charging in RAM (failsafe): Allows like failsafe mode and loaded in RAM, to fully load the system in RAM memory and to deactivate multi-threading support as well as direct access to RAM memory. *Charging in RAM (forensic): This mode allows to load the whole system in RAM, but by activating the functionalities provided with the classic forensic mode.All these options are available on the six languages ​​provided for the live system.Default modeThis mode requires nothing more than typing the enter key on its keyboard to be used. Very useful mode for testing the system, as well as for performing some quick tasks such as disk formatting or disk performance analysis.Failsafe modeThis mode is often used to diagnose problems related to its hardware or to deactivate the support of certain functions which can conflict with certain uses such as multi-threading, management of APM (Advanced Power Management) etc. Do not use this mode if you do not need it. Using it will not cause any problems on your machine or live system, but disables certain functions that may be useful.Forensic modeThis mode allows you to start on a live system by deactivating additional graphics cards. Automatic mounting of disks / partitions and swap are disabled. The purpose of this mode is to be able to more easily diagnose problems related to graphics cards (driver or screen problems related to faulty hardware) and to be able to more easily control the mounting of discs on the system. The automatic deactivation of device mounting makes it possible, for example, to limit the extent of damage that can be caused by malware. This feature is useful for performing disk and / or malware analysis on discs whose origin or content is potentially dangerous.Persistence modeThis mode allows you to keep this data between each live session. However, this mode must be configured beforehand. Persistence mode makes it possible, among other things, to keep the modification of its graphic parameters (wallpaper, theme, policies, etc.), to keep the packages updated, to keep the data entered by the user, etc.Encrypted persistenceThis mode allows you to keep this data between each live session. However, this mode needs to be configured beforehand. The difference with the previous persistent mode, is that persistent data is encrypted, which increases the security, confidentiality and integrity of persistent data. This mode should be used as a priority and is recommended over normal persistent mode, for your safety.Charging in RAMThis mode requires nothing more than typing the enter key on its keyboard to be used. Very useful mode to accelerate the speed of the live system on recent machines, because the system is fully loaded in RAM and therefore faster than a USB port. Useful also to save the USB ports of the machine in case there is not much to see one. Once this mode is used and you have access to the desktop, you can unplug the USB key and fully use the system.Charging in RAM with failsafe modeThis mode also allows you to fully load the system into RAM, but by disabling certain functions such as APM and SMP (like classic failsafe mode). Only use this mode if you have the utility and know why to use it. Using it will not cause any problems on your machine or live system, but disables certain functions that may be useful.Charging in RAM with forensic modeThe forensic mode allows you to automatically deactivate Nvidia graphics cards as well as AMD cards. Storage devices are not mounted automatically. This mode allows you to benefit from all the advantages of this mode while keeping a free USB port on your computer.","ref":"live.html#live-options","title":"Live informations - Live options","type":"extras"},{"doc":"PrerequisiteWARNING: A USB key configured to support live persistent will not work with Apple hardware, surely due to their specific BIOS.We recommend that you have at least a 64GB USB key to take full advantage of this feature.

Since the overwhelming majority of command line tools have multiple options and user parameters (e.g. ls with ls -a ls -l etc ...), it is too complicated to make a launcher by option offered by the software. The software therefore returns a man page or a help page to indicate how the tool is used.Icons next to the launchersThe icons next to launchers (applications) also have their meaning. Each graphic tool has its icon as its logo. The launchers of applications that can be used on the terminal have a terminal as their icon. This is to indicate to the user that this is a command line tool or a graphical tool.

The tools present in the network tools section are mainly diagnostic and troubleshooting tools on almost all layers of the OSI model. Some security tools such as Nmap or Wireshark are integrated, even if they are used a lot in offensive security, they can also be major assets when securing an IS.The system tools are mainly remote administration, backup and virtualization (level 2), containerization, automation tools. It is therefore a category purely focused on the administration of Windows and Linux systems. Tools like Ansible, Docker, parallel-ssh, rsync, zsync to name a few are classified into this category and subcategories.Tools for techniciansIn this menu, are stored all the tools dedicated to the maintenance of computers and their hardware peripherals and operating systems. Several subcategories exist in this menu like disk scan, data recovery, mount tools etc ... Tools like gsmartcontrol, gparted, ddrescue, testdisk, photorec can be found. These tools can also be used by system administrators as part of some of their functions and not just by IT technicians. Data and disk encryption tools are also classified as well.Various toolsIn this menu, are stored the launchers that cannot be entered in the menu for system and network administrators or technicians, because they are too generic. Can be found there for example midnight commander, progress, and also some scripts developed for Kaisen Linux like for example, the kaisen-interface-switcher and kaisen-update (automation of updates and cleaning of non-essential packages). The kaisen-interface-switcher as well as kaisen-update can be launched directly via the menu because they do not require specific arguments to run.FilesystemsThe menu for file systems is a menu that allows to simply reference the tools and commands that can be used to administer, repair, create, diagnose different file systems such as BTRFS, ExFAT, NTFS, XFS, EXT4 etc ... In this category, is contained for example the commands mkfs (create a filesystem on a partition), fsck (repair the filesystem of a partition) etc ... These launchers open a full help or man page.ServicesThis menu has been specially designed to simplify the management of services in a simple way. All the services added by the tools present by default in the distribution are disabled for performance and resource saving reasons. Launchers point to scripts in / opt / services, and are sorted by the name of the service, for example, Avahi, 2ping, etc. Certain categories like containerization as well as virtualization encompass multiple launchers. For example in virtualization, the services for QEMU / KVM, VirtualBox and VMWare are arranged here, this allows to reduce the size of the menu. There are also two additional scripts that allow them to turn everything on or off, to avoid having to manually turn each service on or off in the categories. On these two scripts, logical conditions exist to allow you to run these scripts even if the commands executed by this script return an error because the service does not exist. Scripts can also be started manually with the terminal, but are not intentionally present in /usr/sbin or /sbin because they are intended to be used from the menu (which will only reference the launchers of the installed services).","ref":"menu.html#kaisen-linux-submenus","title":"Menu and Tools overview - Kaisen Linux submenus","type":"extras"},{"doc":"All launchers of each category are present in the menu only if the package associated with the program executed by the launcher is present on the system.

I modified this package to modify the following configurations:*Replace the default bash shell on zsh for user levels in file /etc/adduser.conf *Allow the deletion of the folder associated with a deleted user (/home/userdelete) when it is deleted with the delsuer command in file /etc/deluser.confbase-filesThe base-files package will simply provide the following files on the system:*/etc/debian_version */etc/issue */etc/issue.net */etc/os-releaseThese files are used to identify the system version in details, such as the system version number, distribution name, code name, etc. These files are used by the live system during the welcome message on the system (here Debian has been replaced by Kaisen Linux). They are also used to customize GRUB thanks to the lsb_release package which, in its default configuration will read the /etc/os-release file to find out the version of the OS. By consequently, personalize the GRUB entries in its default configuration by the command lsb_release -i -s (information present in /etc/default/grub at the line GRUB_DISTRIBUTOR) when executing the update-grub command. The goal here was to replace Debian with Kaisen on the GRUB entries of the installed system. This package surely has many other uses, but I have not encountered them so far. The package has therefore been recompiled to formalize the name of the distribution on the system and customize it a little more.linuxThe kernel has been recompiled to generate .udeb files (used by the Debian installer) as well as .deb files needed to install it via apt or dpkg.The Kaisen Linux kernel has its own lean configuration.cronThe package has been modified to automatically add the &quot;kaisen-basemenu-purge&quot; package to automatically clean up duplicate icons on the menu.debian-installerThis package is forked to build the installer with the custom Kaisen Linux kernel as well as our packages used by the installer (rootskel-gtk for example). It is necessary to rebuild the installer to integrate the modified packages for the installer and thus integrate them into the rolling release ISO.rootskel-gtkThis package has been modified because it provides the graphical configuration of the installer (theme, banners). The theme of the Kaisen Linux graphical installer is based on the original Clearlooks theme.apt-setupThis package allows you to configure the /etc/apt/sources.list file after installing the system.Since the Kaisen Linux installer is configured to request no network configuration, this package has been forked to add the Kaisen Linux repository, because by default, without internet connection (therefore no mirror selection), apt-setup will configure the Debian security repositories. choose-mirrorThis package configures the mirrors to be used to download packages. This package has been forked in anticipation of the future, an ISO netinstall is planned.partman-autoThis package, as its name suggests, allows you to automatically partition the disk during installation. This package was forked for three things: Use of BTRFS as default file system on all partitions of the disk (except /boot if the partition is separated)Definition of EXT4 as the default file system for /boot if the partition is separate from / (this is the case for example during the installation of the system with LVM and cryptsetup).Modification of the size of the partitions allocated by partman to adapt it to the size required by Kaisen Linux and thus limit any problems that may appear on insufficient disk space (especially in case of separation of the partitions /home /var /tmp and /).debootstrapThis package builds and installs the base system (the packages mentioned as required). This package is forked to integrate the specific configurations of Kaisen Linux (build the base system from the distribution repository).desktop-baseThis package provides wallpapers for the desktop, login screen, grub etc ...This package is forked to add the different Kaisen themes on the system to provide wallpapers as well as &quot;alternatives&quot; to define by default the theme to use. It is by default configured on kaisen-theme. grub2This package was forked to integrate the kaisen-grub-configuration package as a dependency. This allowed the possibility of providing a GRUB image even when the machine is encrypted and activating the plymouth theme.live-buildIt is the official Debian tool for building system images. It was forked to add support for the &quot;kaisen-rolling&quot; repository.win32-loaderThis package allows you to start the installation of a Debian system directly from a Windows system. The package was forked to simply add the Kaisen Linux logo.shadowThis package was forked because the /etc/default/useradd file was modified to support /bin/zsh as the default terminal when adding a user.The number of users to add to the system has also been changed. Maximum 100 users can be added (by default, 58999 users can be added).live-installerForked to support the kaisen-calamares-settings package.plymouthForked to define kaisen-theme by default for Plymouth.","ref":"packages.html#forked-packages","title":"Packages - Forked packages","type":"extras"},{"doc":"kaisen-basemenu-purgeThis package removes &quot;double&quot; launchers. These duplicate icons appear when updating packages containing a launcher for a graphical application, for example ettercap, lftp, kismet etc ... Custom launchers have been created for the Kaisen menu to organize them by categories (monitoring, scanner etc). The custom launchers are also launched with sudo if necessary by the software.This package therefore removes the original launchers contained in /usr/share/applicationskaisen-grub-configurationThe GRUB package has been recompiled to change the configuration of the /etc/default/grub file to add support for the default splash screen for the user on the installed system (graphical boot) and also allow in case the command lsb_release -i -s cannot be executed because the lsb-release script is not present, you can still display Kaisen and not Debian in the GRUB entries.The kaisen-grub-configuration package is installed automatically during system installation and automates this customization.kaisen-archive-keyringThis package provides the public GPG keys needed to use our secure repository with identity verification via a GPG key (used by official Debian repositories and implemented security by default).kaisen-menuThis package provides the custom menu. This includes the &quot;skeleton&quot; of the menu (allows you to organize the location of the different folders), the directories as well as the launchers of the applications. This menu is mainly used to reference the tools present in the distribution.kaisen-services-managementThis package provides various bash scripts allowing you to easily manage additional services (added by software supplied with the distribution).The scripts are installed in /opt/services. This package coupled with the &quot;kaisen-menu&quot; package allows you to reference and execute directly via the menu the scripts classified by service to activate or deactivate additional services. Two activation and deactivation scripts exist for all services.kaisen-updateThis package just provides a script to perform an apt update &amp;&amp; apt upgrade in one command. The kaisen-update command also allows to remove the most necessary packages (dependencies no longer used).kaisen-buildThis package contains all configurations for build Kaisen Linux ISO.kaisen-interfacesAll Kaisen Linux MATE Desktop Environment configurations (themes, icons etc). This package also installs the default Firefox configurations for Kaisen Linux as well as its translations, terminator, vim and others. This package installs the kaisen-interface-switcher command (MATE version).All Kaisen Linux KDE Desktop Environment configurations (themes, icons etc). This package also installs the default Firefox configurations for Kaisen Linux as well as its translations, terminator, vim and others. This package installs the kaisen-interface-switcher command (KDE version).All Kaisen Linux LXDE Desktop Environment configurations (themes, icons etc). This package also installs the default Firefox configurations for Kaisen Linux as well as its translations, terminator, vim and others. This package installs the kaisen-interface-switcher command.All Kaisen Linux XFCE Desktop Environment configurations (themes, icons etc). This package also installs the default Firefox configurations for Kaisen Linux as well as its translations, terminator, vim and others. This package installs the kaisen-interface-switcher command.kaisen-skeletonThis allows you to have launchers on the desktop, the conky theme...This package replaces the old kaisen-*-default-profile packages which installed only the default profile of the related interface. This package installs the kaisen-update-skel command. kaisen-manpagesThis package is simply an offline implementation of the entire https://kaisenlinux.org/manpages/ domain in order to access the centralized manpages of the tools built into Kaisen Linux without requiring an internet connection. An Apache server is installed with this package to read HTML pages via localhost.veracryptTool to HDD, SSD and system disks encryption.woeusbTool to create Windows USB bootable key.gns3-serverTool to network simulator (server package)gns3-guiTool to network simulator (client package)apfs-fuseFUSE driver for Apple FileSystemubridgeBridge for UDP tunnels, Ethernet, TAP and VMnet interfacesvpcsSimple Virtual PC SimulatordynamipsRouter emulator for GNS3neo4jGraph for everyonebettercapTool to testing the possibility of MITM attacks on Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Ethernet and more.ldapdomaindumpTool to dump Active Directory informations dumper.hfsprescueTool specialized in recovering data from HFS + partitions.conkycolorsTool developed with the aim of simplifying the configuration of the Conky theme.

The reason is simple. It is about optimizing the performance and resources used by the system.When building the ISO, all services are disabled with systemd hooks, which allows once the ISO is built, to be able to use Kaisen Linux with only 500MB to 550MB of RAM on the live as well as on the installed system , which is suitable for very small configurations.We also have the vision, despite the wide range of tools provided by default, to let the user choose to use only what they need, so let these services run in the background, is useless and consumes resources unnecessarily. The tool is present (because we provide a complete live), but if not necessary, it therefore does not encumber any resource (except the disk space used by this program).Management of these servicesSo we have to list these services, as well as to facilitate their management (activation, deactivation) created the &quot;kaisen-services-management&quot; package which installs scripts which will be referenced on the menu in the &quot;Services&quot; tab which will allow activate and deactivate the services listed by sub-tabs for example &quot;zfs-fuse, avahi, cups etc ...&quot; as well as two scripts to activate or deactivate everything.Problem resolutionIf you therefore have an error telling you that the service is not indicated or certain programs (TeamViewer for example) start but are not functional, try to activate the service corresponding to this program (via the menu or simply by typing yourself systemd commands). If that doesn't solve your problem, contact support.","ref":"faq.html#why-are-all-additional-services-disabled-by-default","title":"Frequently asked Questions - Why are all additional services disabled by default ?","type":"extras"},{"doc":"kaisen-buildA package called kaisen-build has been developed to allow you to build your custom ISO based on Kaisen Linux. It is also this package and the tools it installs that we use to build official releases. The main objective of building your own ISO is to create your own live system and have one more up to date while awaiting official publications from the Kaisen Linux team. The second objective of doing this is to integrate into your live system tools which are not integrated by default in Kaisen Linux and which need to use them on a live system.Note that creating a custom ISO also includes the Debian installer (default configuration provided by kaisen-build) customized by us (graphic theme, file systems, partitioning, preseed etc ...). Doing this is not useful for having a newer installable system, just do apt update &amp;&amp; apt upgrade to have your system constantly updated and with your software installed. We advise you to use kaisen-build in order to create your own live system.The different variantsWe have the following variants:KDE LXDE MATE XFCE SR CUSTOMISO image type:KDE = Live system ISO and included installer with KDE GUI only LXDE = Live system ISO and included installer with LXDE/Openbox GUI only (LXDE by default) MATE = Live system ISO and included installer with MATE GUI only XFCE = Live system ISO and included installer with MATE GUI only SR = Live system ISO and not installer included with LXDE/Openbox GUI only (LXDE by default) CUSTOM = Live system ISO and included installer for user ISO settingsThese variants include tools:KDE = All metapackages are included on this variant LXDE = All metapackages are included on this variant MATE = All metapackages are included on this variant XFCE = All metapackages are included on this variant SR = All technicians, filesystems, miscellaneous, firmwares are included on this variant CUSTOM = Variant pre-configured, but no integrated tool. Variant reserved for the user, the user parameters will be kept.How to proceed?Install kaisen-build with the sudo apt install kaisen-build command. The package will install live-build (a set of scripts used by Debian to build their official ISO images, which we also use), live-manual and live-doc which will help you get started with the live-build configuration and customize your ISO, live-boot to start your live.Once the package is installed, in /home/* you will have a folder named kaisen-build.In the kaisen-build/variant/ folder, there is the folder named CUSTOM. This folder is reserved for you so that you can make your ISO live and installable (these options are by default in the live-build configuration file that I do not recommend that you modify), this file is complete and some options are already preconfigured like official Kaisen Linux packages, GUIs, as well as the Debian Installer preseed LINK TO ADD file.In the event of an update, or even in the event of accidental deletion of the package and after a reinstallation, all the modifications made on the custom branch will be kept, thanks to an automated backup and automatic restoration of the CUSTOM branch in the installation process of the package.This is why I strongly advise you not to create your ISO by customizing another variant than CUSTOM because your modifications will be lost in the event of an update of kaisen-build.Once your branch is fully configured, you can run a compilation at the root of the kaisen-build folder, with the command:sudo ./kaisen-build build CUSTOM If you want to put a version number to your ISO, put this: sudo ./kaisen-build build CUSTOM 1.0Version 1.0 is an example, but you can put whatever you want, I advise you not to put too many letters and numbers because if the name of the ISO volume exceeds 32 characters, the compilation will crash. The name of the ISO volume is &quot;Kaisen Linux Rolling $variant $version&quot; ($variant corresponds here to CUSTOM and $version corresponds here to 1.0), in the example, the name of the ISO volume will be Kaisen Linux Rolling CUSTOM 1.0.Further informationSupportPlease be aware that we will not provide support to users wishing to create their own ISO. Not that we don't want to help you, but we are very busy professionally and on the constant development of Kaisen Linux.Warning on personal imagesOne of the strengths of the GNU/Linux world, which we follow to give our users the choice to do what they want with the environment we provide them so that they can adapt it to their needs, is also a problem because the integration of malware, trackers or others can be facilitated.To avoid this kind of inconvenience, do not download an ISO image outside the following two mirrors: https://iso.kaisenlinux.org and https://kaisen.lf.je/index.htmlAlso check the SHA256 checksums indicated on the official website. So keep your images created by yourself for yourself, and do not use ISOS images whose origin thereof is not a certainty (check the checksums on the site to be sure).Update CUSTOM branchIf you want to start from scratch or update the CUSTOM branch to have our latest pre-configuration (although changes are rare), you must uninstall and completely purge the package then reinstall it.To do this, you have to run this command: sudo apt remove --purge kaisen-buildYou will just have to reinstall the package and you will be on the last pre-configuration of the CUSTOM branch.Be careful, this action will delete your settings from the CUSTOM branch (even the automated backups, so that they are not reapplied when the package is reinstalled). Be sure what you are doing, manually save your settings beforehand if you want to keep your settings.","ref":"faq.html#how-to-build-a-custom-iso","title":"Frequently asked Questions - How to build a custom ISO ?","type":"extras"},{"doc":"Softwares non-freeSoftware like TeamViewer, Anydesk for example do not have their sources open.

However, this method has a problem, it erases all the customization of the user, namely terminal, configurations of the graphic environment (location of icons, etc.), configuration of the .zshrc file (and possibly the conky theme).This command therefore overwrites all the modified configurations (if the same file is present in the skel), to be used with caution and only if you know what you are doing.Manual methodThis method requires only going to find the files that we want to update and to integrate in /etc/skel and copy them in /home/* or /root.This gives you more control over what we update and decreases the chances of your configurations being overwritten. Note, however, that this method is the least simple, but the most refined, it is not suitable for less experienced users.When to do it?When the kaisen-skeleton package is updated, it means that the default GUI profile has been updated. The kaisen-update-skel command can be used to copy new content from /etc/skel to /home/* and /root.

How to update conky?In case you are using the default conky theme provided by your GUI, you don't have to do anything. For example, if you are using MATE, when the kaisen-mate package is updated, the conky theme will also be updated automatically!Launch conky with a custom themeIt's easy to run your own conky setup. You must modify the conffile /etc/xdg/autostart/conky.desktop This file contains this by default:[Desktop Entry] Name=Kaisen Linux Conky Exec=/usr/bin/conky Hidden=false Type=Application X-KDE-Autostart-enabled=true X-LXDE-Autostart-enabled=true X-MATE-Autostart-enabled=true X-XFCE-Autostart-enabled=trueIn this example, your conky configuration file will be called: .myconkyconfYou will simply have to replace the file like this:[Desktop Entry] Name=Kaisen Linux Conky Exec=/usr/bin/conky --config ~/.conkyconf Hidden=false Type=Application X-KDE-Autostart-enabled=true X-LXDE-Autostart-enabled=true X-MATE-Autostart-enabled=true X-XFCE-Autostart-enabled=trueThe next time you start conky, your own configuration will be executed.

Problems with KDE desktopExplanationsI have seen some issues with KDE.The conky is initially configured to be completely transparent and integrated into the wallpaper. KDE does not natively allow to do this, to make its integration possible, I used the software feh which via a script in /usr/share/kaisen-kde will read the file ~/.config/plasma-org.kde.plasma.desktop-appletsrc to determine the wallpaper image and display it.Unfortunately today, I have no way to completely correct this problem (unless you run the script all the time, which has a significant impact on performance), this section will aim to help you fully customize the KDE environment provided according to your settings.ProblemsHowever, this technique has a limit. Although the main problem is bypassed, the wallpapers in slideshow mode are not updated via the script, and would imply relaunching it at each image change. The user parameters being very personal, it is impossible for me to correctly determine the refresh sequence. ResolutionThe problem of updating images in slideshow mode with Conky can be solved either by disabling Conky or by loading a custom configuration according to your settings.Be careful however, the script to run feh consumes resources, running it constantly or too often can significantly reduce the performance of your machines. Here are several examples of how to modify Conky for slideshow mode: The slideshow refreshes every minute, and Conky should do the same, so replace in the .conkyrc:${texeci 999999 /usr/share/kaisen-kde/conkyfeh}By:${texeci 60 /usr/share/kaisen-kde/conkyfeh}The slideshow refreshes every ten minutes, and Conky should do the same, so replace in the .conkyrc:${texeci 999999 /usr/share/kaisen-kde/conkyfeh}By:${texeci 600 /usr/share/kaisen-kde/conkyfeh}Once you have edited the file, copy the ~/.conkyrc file to for example ~/.conkyrc_custom and modify the /etc/xdg/autostart/conky.desktop file as mentioned here. When restarting the session, the new congiuration will be loaded.Alternatively, you can disable conky launch if you don't want to reconfigure the conky theme, as shown here.Relaunch conky manuallySometimes, Conky may not automatically relaunch after a package update. To relaunch it, it is very simple. Open a terminal window, and type this command: conky&amp;Next this command, press ctrl +D until closing the terminal.

As a security measure, on UNIX systems, never use the root account but rather use sudo. This allows the increase of the security of the system (also reduces the risks of malware infections), allows to have better control over the actions of the user as well as the traceability of his actions.We have also based our entire default profile for normal users, especially with zsh, which is the default shell for normal users, but is not that of root (that of root is bash, to facilitate chroot systems).We have therefore chosen to deactivate this possibility.So how do you get root rights?By default, when installing the system with a user and a password entered (which is not offered when we enter a password for root, because root becomes our current user), the installer puts default this user in the sudo group without any restriction on the machine, the sudo command gives you all access.We have not, despite our attachment to system security, not disabled the possibility of putting a password on root after installation (sudo passwd root command) nor have we disabled the sudo su or su root.We believe that as users, you are free to use the system as you see fit, without any particular constraints. However, we always advise you to use sudo when you need root is to leave root disabled (without password), this can save you from some errors that can harm your system.AdviceWe do not recommend using the root account from a graphical session.And this because increases the risk of making a false manipulation, creating directories with root rights when root is not necessary, and others.Some scripts developed for Kaisen Linux are also developed only for regular user accounts (even without sudo rights), because root should not be used from a graphical session.This will surely never change, admittedly I remove you by default the possibility to put a password on root, but you can entirely use it in command line via the commands sudo su - or sudo -i.Using the root account from a graphical session is unnecessary, dangerous and stupid. It can also cause problems for some scripts developed for Kaisen like for example the kaisen-interface-switcher or any other script saving standard user configurations. You have been warned. ConclusionUse sudo when you need root.Log in as root with the sudo su -, sudo -i, and su command (su command only works if you have set a root password with the passwd root command).","ref":"faq.html#why-root-account-is-disabled-by-default","title":"Frequently asked Questions - Why root account is disabled by default ?","type":"extras"},{"doc":"ExplanationBy default, the root user defaults to bash because it is not expected in good practice to be used for human operations, except in cases where there is no choice.

You have to purge the old one (not mandatory, but avoids overloading the system and avoiding potential conflicts), and install the new interface.A package has been created for each GUI officially supported by Kaisen Linux installing all of the predefined configurations.For this a tool has been created to do it simply and fully automated!This tool was also created so that the user does not come to reinstall his OS in the event of difficulties.kaisen-interface-switcherThe script since Kaisen Linux revision 1.4 is designed when the script starts up (after all checks have been made), to update itself if a new, more recent version of the script (installed by the kaisen-kde package, kaisen-lxde, kaisen-mate, kaisen-xfce depending on your current GUI). This is intended if you do not update often, to be able to change your interface and update the list of packages to uninstall. The main purpose of this is to automate the task even more, saving you time.The kaisen-interface-switcher script allows you to change your graphical interface by installing the one of your choice by removing your current graphical interface. It can be started by the sudo kaisen-interface-switcher command.The first versions of this script reinstalled for each user the default profile of each interface (execution of the kaisen-interface-switcher command during the script) but this lost the personalization of the user if he wishes to reinstall his graphical interface. 'original (e.g. switching from MATE to KDE then from KDE to MATE).This problem has been corrected by replacing the installation of a default profile per interface with a package installing the default profile for all graphical interfaces (see kaisen-skeleton. You can therefore change the graphical interface at will, without losing a single one of your settings!PrerequisitesSince revision 1.4, the kaisen-interface-switcher script has been corrected to fix some issues that occurred when using the script (eg when using wifi or with wrong proxy settings).To be able to use kaisen-interface-switcher, the script will check two things: Connectivity to APT (if behind a proxy, only the configuration of the APT proxy is sufficient)The network interface through which network packets pass. The script will remove all packages installed by your current GUI, it will also remove network-manager, and without network-manager the wifi cannot work. This therefore prevented the installation of your new graphical interface, and the old one was deleted, the next time you restart your machine, you would find yourself without a graphical interface.So I added as many checks as possible to limit the risk of losing the graphic interface during the process. I strongly advise against modifying the script yourself to modify checks or the like unless you know exactly what you are doing. WorkingThe script will automatically save the graphics settings and profile of all system users (except root) who have a home directory in /home, regardless of the UID number.The directories will be saved in /usr/share/kaisen-interface-switcher/$users/INTERFACE_NAME depending on the interface selected (and therefore the script launched, therefore MATE, KDE, LXDE or XFCE version).The selected interface will be installed after uninstalling the initial interface.Once the installation is complete, if automatic backups of the interface installed by the script exist in the dedicated directory, they will be copied to the users present on the system. In the event of an error (a user has been deleted in the meantime, as well as his home directory, or other reason), the content of the /etc/skel folder will be copied (only where it failed, if possible).","ref":"faq.html#how-to-change-graphical-interface","title":"Frequently asked Questions - How to change graphical interface ?","type":"extras"},{"doc":"Classic methodWith Kaisen Linux now in rolling mode, the entire system can be updated without having to systematically reinstall it.
