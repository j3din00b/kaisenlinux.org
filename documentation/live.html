  Live options
</h2>
<p>Kaisen Linux live has several options:</p><ul><li>Default</li><li>Failsafe mode</li><li>Persistence</li><li>Encrypted persistence</li><li>Forensic mode</li><li>Charging in RAM</li><li>Charging in RAM (failsafe)</li><li>Charging in RAM (forensic)</li></ul><pre><code class="bash">*Default: Simple start in live mode without special options.
*Failsafe mode: Repair mode and disables certain features such as multi-threading and direct access to RAM. 
Facilitates the detection of problems.
*Persistence: Mode allowing to keep this data on different live sessions (by default, the live erases all the data of the session once the computer is shut down or restarted). CAUTION: This mode can only be used with a bootable USB key with a partition dedicated to persistence. More details in the section dedicated to the use of the persistent mode.
*Encrypted persistence: Exactly the same function as persistence mode, with the only difference, the partition with persistent data will be secured using cryptsetup and luks.
*Forensic mode: Mode allowing to start the system by bringing certain security there like deactivation of the assembly by default of the equipment connected in USB and the deactivation of graphics cards AMD and Nvidia. The swap 
(partition used by the system to compensate for a possible lack of RAM) is also disabled with this mode.
*Charging in RAM: Mode allowing to fully load the squashfs in the RAM memory, allowing to use the live system without keeping the USB key connected. Useful for computers with few USB ports. 8Gb of RAM is recommended to use this mode. The system loaded in RAM consumes 3.5GB to 4GB.
*Charging in RAM (failsafe): Allows like failsafe mode and loaded in RAM, to fully load the system in RAM memory and to deactivate multi-threading support as well as direct access to RAM memory.
*Charging in RAM (forensic): This mode allows to load the whole system in RAM, but by activating the functionalities provided with the classic forensic mode.</code></pre><p>All these options are available on the six languages ​​provided for the live system.</p><h3 id="default-mode" class="section-heading">
  <a href="#default-mode" class="hover-link"><span class="icon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
  Default mode
</h3>
<p>This mode requires nothing more than typing the enter key on its keyboard to be used. Very useful mode for testing the system, as well as for performing some quick tasks such as disk formatting or disk performance analysis.</p><h3 id="failsafe-mode" class="section-heading">
  <a href="#failsafe-mode" class="hover-link"><span class="icon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
  Failsafe mode
</h3>
<p>This mode is often used to diagnose problems related to its hardware or to deactivate the support of certain functions which can conflict with certain uses such as multi-threading, management of APM (Advanced Power Management) etc. Do not use this mode if you do not need it. Using it will not cause any problems on your machine or live system, but disables certain functions that may be useful.</p><h3 id="forensic-mode" class="section-heading">
  <a href="#forensic-mode" class="hover-link"><span class="icon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
  Forensic mode
</h3>
<p>This mode allows you to start on a live system by deactivating additional graphics cards.
Automatic mounting of disks / partitions and swap are disabled. The purpose of this mode is to be able to more easily diagnose problems related to graphics cards (driver or screen problems related to faulty hardware) and to be able to more easily control the mounting of discs on the system. The automatic deactivation of device mounting makes it possible, for example, to limit the extent of damage that can be caused by malware. This feature is useful for performing disk and / or malware analysis on discs whose origin or content is potentially dangerous.</p><h3 id="persistence-mode" class="section-heading">
  <a href="#persistence-mode" class="hover-link"><span class="icon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
  Persistence mode
</h3>
<p>This mode allows you to keep this data between each live session. However, this mode must be configured beforehand. Persistence mode makes it possible, among other things, to keep the modification of its graphic parameters (wallpaper, theme, policies, etc.), to keep the packages updated, to keep the data entered by the user, etc.</p><h3 id="encrypted-persistence" class="section-heading">
  <a href="#encrypted-persistence" class="hover-link"><span class="icon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
  Encrypted persistence
</h3>
<p>This mode allows you to keep this data between each live session. However, this mode needs to be configured beforehand. The difference with the previous persistent mode, is that persistent data is encrypted, which increases the security, confidentiality and integrity of persistent data. This mode should be used as a priority and is recommended over normal persistent mode, for your safety.</p><h3 id="charging-in-ram" class="section-heading">
  <a href="#charging-in-ram" class="hover-link"><span class="icon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
  Charging in RAM
</h3>
<p>This mode requires nothing more than typing the enter key on its keyboard to be used. Very useful mode to accelerate the speed of the live system on recent machines, because the system is fully loaded in RAM and therefore faster than a USB port. Useful also to save the USB ports of the machine in case there is not much to see one. Once this mode is used and you have access to the desktop, you can unplug the USB key and fully use the system.</p><h3 id="charging-in-ram-with-failsafe-mode" class="section-heading">
  <a href="#charging-in-ram-with-failsafe-mode" class="hover-link"><span class="icon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
  Charging in RAM with failsafe mode
</h3>
<p>This mode also allows you to fully load the system into RAM, but by disabling certain functions such as APM and SMP (like classic failsafe mode). Only use this mode if you have the utility and know why to use it. Using it will not cause any problems on your machine or live system, but disables certain functions that may be useful.</p><h3 id="charging-in-ram-with-forensic-mode" class="section-heading">
  <a href="#charging-in-ram-with-forensic-mode" class="hover-link"><span class="icon-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
  Charging in RAM with forensic mode
</h3>
<p>The forensic mode allows you to automatically deactivate Nvidia graphics cards as well as AMD cards. Storage devices are not mounted automatically. This mode allows you to benefit from all the advantages of this mode while keeping a free USB port on your computer.</p><h2 id="create-live-usb-key-with-persistence" class="section-heading">

  <strong>Prerequisite</strong>
</h3>
<p>WARNING: A USB key configured to support live persistent will not work with Apple hardware, surely due to their specific BIOS.</p><p>We recommend that you have at least a 64GB USB key to take full advantage of this feature. Delete your current partition entirely with Gparted and create a partition table in GPT, dd will do the rest for you. You don't need to format the partition with any file system.
